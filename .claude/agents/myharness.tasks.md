## Execution Logging & Phase Report (Constitution Art. XI & XII)

### ⛔ MANDATORY — Two Output Files Required

This agent **MUST** create one output file during execution. The pipeline CANNOT advance to the next step without it.

| # | File | Path | When |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | **Phase Report** | `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/09-tasks-report.md` | **LAST** — after all other work |

### Step 0 — Setup

**Before doing ANY other work**, you MUST:

1. Determine `<feature-id>` from the context
2. Create directories: `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/` and `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/`

### Step FINAL — Write Phase Report (⚠️ DO THIS LAST — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Write to: `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/09-tasks-report.md`

> 📄 Follow **Universal Report Structure** from `.harness/agents/templates/report-templates.md` (STEP 09).

**Step-specific overrides:**

- **Title:** `# STEP 7: Task Generation Report`
- **Agent:** `myharness.tasks (GPT-5.4)`
- **Input:** implementation plan (`plan.md`), specification (`spec.md`), data model (`data-model.md`)
- **Output:** task list (`specs/<feature-id>/tasks.md`)
- **Quality evaluation categories:** task completeness, dependency consistency, phase breakdown validity
- **Metrics:** task count, phase count, dependency link count
- **Next phase:** `myharness.implement` (STEP 8) — implementation execution

### ⛔ COMPLETION HARD GATE

Report file `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/09-tasks-report.md` MUST exist with ALL sections before returning.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Platform Detection

**Before running any `.specify/scripts/` script**, detect OS and use the correct script path + flag style:

| OS | Script path | Flag style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `.specify/scripts/powershell/<script>.ps1` | `-Json`, `-PathsOnly`, `-RequireTasks`, `-IncludeTasks` |
| macOS / Linux | `.specify/scripts/bash/<script>.sh` | `--json`, `--paths-only`, `--require-tasks`, `--include-tasks` |

All script references below show the PowerShell form. On macOS/Linux, substitute the bash path and Unix-style flags.

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json` (macOS/Linux: `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json`) from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (interface contracts), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map interface contracts to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:

   **Output Language**: Produce `tasks.md` in English. Technical IDs (T001, [US1], [P], etc.) remain unchanged.
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Write/Read Sets (REQUIRED — MyHarness addition)

Every task MUST declare its `write:` and `read:` sets immediately after the checkbox line.
orchestrator uses these sets to detect file conflicts before parallel dispatch.

```text
- [ ] T001 [P] [US1] Description with file path
  - write: [`path/to/file.ts`]
  - read: [`specs/FEATURE-ID/plan.md`]
```

**Rules:**

- `write:` MUST list every file the task creates or modifies — use exact paths
- `read:` lists key input files (plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md relevant sections)
- Tasks with overlapping `write:` paths CANNOT be marked `[P]`
- Tasks without `write:` declared are treated as sequential (unknown = sequential)

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
  - write: [`exact/path/file.ts`]
  - read: [`specs/FEATURE-ID/plan.md`]
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT:

  ```
  - [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
    - write: [`backend/src/modules/auth/`]
    - read: [`specs/FEATURE-ID/plan.md`]
  ```

- ✅ CORRECT (parallel):

  ```
  - [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in backend/src/modules/users/user.entity.ts
    - write: [`backend/src/modules/users/user.entity.ts`]
    - read: [`specs/FEATURE-ID/data-model.md`]
  ```

- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID, story label, write set)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model` (missing write: declaration — cannot be [P])

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Interfaces/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each interface contract → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each interface contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
