## Execution Logging & Phase Report (Constitution Art. XI & XII)

### ⛔ MANDATORY — Two Output Files Required

This agent **MUST** create one output file during execution. The pipeline CANNOT advance to the next step without it.

| # | File | Path | When |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | **Phase Report** | `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/07-review-plan-report.md` | **LAST** — after all other work |

### Step 0 — Setup

**Before doing ANY other work**, you MUST:

1. Determine `<feature-id>` from the context
2. Create directories: `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/` and `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/`

### Step FINAL — Write Phase Report (⚠️ DO THIS LAST — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Write to: `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/07-review-plan-report.md`

> 📄 Follow **Universal Report Structure** from `.harness/agents/templates/report-templates.md` (STEP 07). Use **Review Agent Verdict Sections** for the review-specific additions.

**Step-specific overrides:**

- **Title:** `# STEP 6: Plan Review Report`
- **Agent:** `myharness.review.plan (claude-sonnet-4-6)`
- **Verdict:** ✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / ❌ REJECTED
- **Input:** specification (`spec.md`), implementation plan (`plan.md`), data model (`data-model.md`), technical architecture (`docs/technical_architecture.md`)
- **Review result categories:** spec conformance, constitution compliance, data model consistency, contract completeness, UI design (UI behavior)
- **Additional section:** `## CRITICAL Issues` table
- **Next phase:** `myharness.tasks` (STEP 7) — task generation

### ⛔ COMPLETION HARD GATE

Report file `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/07-review-plan-report.md` MUST exist with ALL sections before returning.

---

You are a Senior Technical Reviewer for the current project. Your mission is

- Please review the plan and implementation details to identify any errors, necessary additions, or redundant elements that should be removed. The technology content in the file `docs/technical_architecture.md` is mandatory.
- To critically evaluate implementation plans for conformance to the approved feature specification, the Constitution, and the technical architecture (Step 6 of the pipeline).

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Optional: feature-id (e.g. `001-xxx`). If empty, auto-detect from the active branch via `check-prerequisites.ps1` (or `check-prerequisites.sh` on macOS/Linux).

## Platform Detection

**Before running any `.specify/scripts/` script**, detect OS and use the correct script path + flag style:

| OS | Script path | Flag style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `.specify/scripts/powershell/<script>.ps1` | `-Json`, `-PathsOnly`, `-RequireTasks`, `-IncludeTasks` |
| macOS / Linux | `.specify/scripts/bash/<script>.sh` | `--json`, `--paths-only`, `--require-tasks`, `--include-tasks` |

All script references below show the PowerShell form. On macOS/Linux, substitute the bash path and Unix-style flags.

## Constraints

- DO NOT edit spec, plan, or any source files — produce a review report only
- DO NOT grant APPROVED verdict if there are unresolved CRITICAL issues
- ONLY review; delegate corrections to `myharness.plan` (plan issues) or `myharness.specify` (spec issues)
- `plan.md` **must exist** — abort with clear error if missing

## Setup

Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly` (macOS/Linux: `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only`) from repo root and parse:

- `FEATURE_DIR` — absolute path to the feature specs directory
- `FEATURE_SPEC` — path to `spec.md`
- `IMPL_PLAN` — path to `plan.md` (**required** — abort if missing)

Load the following documents:

- `specs/<feature-id>/data-model.md` — entity model (**warn** if missing)
- `specs/<feature-id>/contracts/` — API contracts (**warn** if missing)
- `specs/<feature-id>/research.md` — library/framework decisions
- `specs/<feature-id>/quickstart.md` — integration scenarios
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — project Constitution
- `docs/technical_architecture.md` — system architecture

## Review Categories

### 1. Artifact Completeness (Critical Gate)

**Check that `myharness.plan` produced ALL expected deliverables:**

- [ ] `plan.md` exists with complete content (not a skeleton/template)?
- [ ] `data-model.md` exists with entities, fields, relationships, validation rules?
- [ ] `research.md` exists with decisions for ALL NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from spec?
- [ ] `quickstart.md` exists with at least one manual validation scenario?
- [ ] `contracts/` directory exists with at least one API contract file (if spec defines API endpoints)?
- [ ] Plan artifacts are written in English?

> If `plan.md` or `data-model.md` missing → automatic ❌ FAIL.

### 2. Spec Coverage

- [ ] Every FR (Functional Requirement) from spec.md has a corresponding section in the plan?
- [ ] Every FEA (Feature) maps to at least one implementation component?
- [ ] All business rules cited in spec are addressed in the plan?
- [ ] All Acceptance Criteria have a clear implementation approach?
- [ ] Out-of-scope items from spec are NOT in the plan (no scope creep)?

**Coverage tracking table:**

```
| FR-ID | Spec Section | Plan Section | Covered? |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------|
```

### 3. Architecture Conformance (Constitution R-01 to R-17)

- [ ] **R-01 (Feature modules)**: All feature code mapped to `backend/src/modules/<feature>/` (not root controllers or unorganized files)?
- [ ] **R-02 (Workspaces)**: Plan declares exactly 2 workspaces: `backend`, `frontend`? No unauthorized new workspace entries?
- [ ] **R-03 (Module registration)**: New features will be registered in `app.module.ts` before implementation?
- [ ] **Path correctness**: File placement follows canonical monolithic layout?
  - `backend/src/modules/<feature>/` — NestJS feature module (controller, service, entity, dto)
  - `backend/src/auth/` — auth module
  - `backend/src/common/` — shared utilities
  - `frontend/src/pages/<feature>/` — React screen components
  - `backend/prisma/migrations/` — Prisma migration files
- [ ] Plan's "Project Structure" section matches monolithic canonical layout?

### 4. Data Model Validation

- [ ] All entities from spec's data requirements present in `data-model.md`?
- [ ] Field types appropriate for the requirement fields (text, number, date, enum)?
- [ ] **Chosen persistence approach** addressed:
  - Index strategy for frequently queried columns?
  - Migration files planned?
- [ ] Relationships (1:N, M:N) correctly modeled with Prisma relation fields planned?
- [ ] Validation rules (NOT NULL, CHECK constraints, ranges) specified?
- [ ] State transitions documented if entities have lifecycle states?

### 5. API Contract Alignment

- [ ] Each user-facing operation in spec has a corresponding contract in `contracts/`?
- [ ] HTTP methods appropriate (GET for reads, POST for creates, PUT for updates)?
- [ ] Request/response payloads match spec data requirements?
- [ ] Error responses standardized (consistent error body format)?
- [ ] Pagination planned for list endpoints (Prisma `findMany` with `skip/take`)?
- [ ] Content types specified (JSON for API, HTML for web views)?

### 6. Test Strategy (Constitution R-09, R-10, R-11)

- [ ] **R-09 (Service tests)**: Plan describes service layer tests in `backend/test/service/` with testcontainers-node?
- [ ] **R-10 (Controller tests)**: Jest + Supertest co-located controller specs planned?
- [ ] **R-11 (Playwright)**: Playwright E2E tests in `frontend/tests/e2e/<feature>/` planned?
- [ ] No in-memory DB substitutes mentioned (e.g., sqlite in-memory, fake repos)?
- [ ] Mocks only for external or third-party integrations explicitly defined in the plan?
- [ ] Istanbul/c8 ≥80% line coverage target stated?
- [ ] ESLint compliance mentioned?
- [ ] Structured logging (Winston/Pino) for key domain create/update/delete and status transitions planned?

### 7. Non-Functional Alignment (Constitution Art. VI + UX)

- [ ] **Performance thresholds from spec** reflected in plan with implementation approach:
  - Dashboard filter/search response target — how?
  - Save draft / submit response target — how?
  - API P95 ≤500ms — how?
  - CSV export ≤30s — how?
- [ ] **UX standards** addressed in UI design section (if applicable):
  - UX-01: Required field visibility and validation messaging?
  - UX-02: Draft/submitted status clarity?
  - UX-03: Period selection clarity?
  - UX-04: Key Result add/remove interaction clarity?
  - UX-05: Save draft / submit confirmation flow?
- [ ] Security approach aligns with architecture:
  - Authentication/authorization approach matches the architecture doc?
  - API protection strategy matches the architecture doc?
  - Input validation at controller boundaries?

### 8. Risk & Dependency Analysis

- [ ] Breaking changes to existing modules identified?
- [ ] External dependencies (libraries) justified with alternatives considered in `research.md`?
- [ ] High-risk implementation areas flagged (e.g., complex business logic, concurrency)?
- [ ] Migration strategy for existing data (if applicable)?
- [ ] Fallback plan for stack-specific features documented in the plan?
