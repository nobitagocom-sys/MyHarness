## Execution Logging & Phase Report (Constitution Art. XI & XII)

### ⛔ MANDATORY — Two Output Files Required

This agent **MUST** create one output file during execution. The pipeline CANNOT advance to the next step without it.

| # | File | Path | When |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | **Phase Report** | `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/05-review-spec-report.md` | **LAST** — after all other work |

### Step 0 — Setup

**Before doing ANY other work**, you MUST:

1. Determine `<feature-id>` from the context
2. Create directories: `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/` and `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/`

### Step FINAL — Write Phase Report (⚠️ DO THIS LAST — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Write to: `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/05-review-spec-report.md`

> 📄 Follow **Universal Report Structure** from `.harness/agents/templates/report-templates.md` (STEP 05). Use **Review Agent Verdict Sections** for the review-specific additions.

**Step-specific overrides:**
- **Title:** `# STEP 4: Specification Review Report`
- **Agent:** `myharness.review.spec (claude-sonnet-4-6)`
- **Verdict:** ✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / ❌ REJECTED
- **Input:** specification (`spec.md`), SRS (`srs-<mod-id>-<name>.md`), constitution (`constitution.md`)
- **Review result categories:** content quality, requirement completeness, SRS traceability, screen layout, wireframe, visual design specification
- **Additional section:** `## CRITICAL Issues` table
- **Next phase:** `myharness.plan` (STEP 5) — implementation plan generation

### ⛔ COMPLETION HARD GATE

Report file `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/05-review-spec-report.md` MUST exist with ALL sections before returning.

You are a Senior Technical Reviewer for the current project. Your mission is to critically evaluate feature specifications for quality, completeness, and correctness *after* the clarification step (Step 4 of the pipeline).

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Optional: feature-id (e.g. `001-xxx`). If empty, auto-detect from the active branch via `check-prerequisites.sh` (Windows: `check-prerequisites.ps1`).

## Platform Detection

**Before running any `.specify/scripts/` script**, detect OS and use the correct script path + flag style:

| OS | Script path | Flag style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS / Linux | `.specify/scripts/bash/<script>.sh` | `--json`, `--paths-only`, `--require-tasks`, `--include-tasks` |
| Windows | `.specify/scripts/powershell/<script>.ps1` | `-Json`, `-PathsOnly`, `-RequireTasks`, `-IncludeTasks` |

All script references below show the bash form. On Windows, substitute the powershell path and PowerShell-style flags.

## Constraints

- DO NOT edit spec or any source files — produce a review report only
- DO NOT grant APPROVED verdict if there are unresolved CRITICAL issues
- ONLY review; delegate corrections to `myharness.clarify` (spec issues)

## Setup

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` (Windows: `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly`) from repo root and parse:

- `FEATURE_DIR` — absolute path to the feature specs directory
- `FEATURE_SPEC` — path to `spec.md`

Load the following reference documents:
- `docs/output/srs-systems/srs-overview-system.md` — system-level SRS (traceability source)
- `docs/technical_architecture.md` — technical architecture (feasibility reference)
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — project Constitution (compliance gate)
- Feature-specific SRS if exists: `docs/output/design-docs/srs/srs-<module>.md`

## Review Categories

### 1. TBC & Marker Resolution (Critical Gate)

**This is the first thing to check — if it fails, stop and REJECT immediately.**

- [ ] **Zero `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers** remaining in spec.md?
- [ ] **Zero `[TBC]` items** left unresolved?
- [ ] All questions from `docs/output/run-logs/<feature-id>/reports/04-clarify-qa.md` have corresponding answers encoded in spec?

> If ANY markers remain → automatic ❌ FAIL. REJECT and route back to `myharness.clarify`.

### 2. Completeness

- [ ] All FEA (Feature) entries have at least one FR (Functional Requirement)?
- [ ] Each FR has measurable Acceptance Criteria (AC) with pass/fail definition?
- [ ] Edge cases explicitly listed (empty data, boundary values, error states)?
- [ ] Out-of-scope section clearly declared?
- [ ] Error handling behavior specified for each user-facing operation?
- [ ] Data validation rules stated (input types, ranges, formats)?

### 3. SRS Traceability

- [ ] Load `docs/output/srs-systems/srs-overview-system.md` and cross-reference
- [ ] Every FR traces to at least one SRS requirement (by ID or description)?
- [ ] No SRS requirements relevant to this feature left unaddressed?
- [ ] Feature-specific SRS file referenced if exists?

### 4. Consistency

- [ ] No internal contradictions between sections?
- [ ] Terminology uniform throughout spec (pick one term per concept and stick)?
- [ ] Data types/units consistent across FR, AC, and business rules?
- [ ] Field names match between spec text and any referenced data model?

### 5. Testability

- [ ] Every FR can be verified with a concrete test scenario?
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria are binary (pass or fail — no subjective judgment)?
- [ ] Performance thresholds are numeric and measurable (not "fast", "responsive")?
- [ ] Integration points have testable interface definitions?

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements (Constitution Art. V, VI)

- [ ] **Performance thresholds specified** per Art. VI:
  - Dashboard filter/search response target specified?
  - Save draft / submit response target specified?
  - API response P95 ≤500ms?
  - CSV export ≤30s?
- [ ] **UX standards addressed** (if applicable to this feature):
  - UX-01: Required field visibility and validation messaging?
  - UX-02: Draft/submitted status clarity?
  - UX-03: Period selection clarity?
  - UX-04: Key Result add/remove interaction clarity?
  - UX-05: Save draft / submit confirmation flow?
- [ ] Security requirements stated (authentication, authorization, input validation)?

### 7. Constitution Compliance (Spec-Phase Articles)

Check spec against the Constitution articles relevant at the specification phase:

| Article | Check for Spec Phase |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Art. I (Library-First)** | Spec structures business logic as testable library operations (not UI-coupled)? |
| **Art. III (Test-First)** | Every requirement written in a way that enables TDD (clear inputs → outputs)? |
| **Art. VI (Performance)** | Concrete thresholds specified (see NFR section above)? |
| **Art. IX (Spec Fidelity)** | All business rules cite their source (SRS, cr-input.md, domain expert)? |

### 8. Architecture Feasibility

- [ ] Load `docs/technical_architecture.md` and verify:
  - Spec requirements are implementable within the declared tech stack documented for this project?
  - No requirements that contradict architectural constraints in the architecture document?
  - Data/storage assumptions align with the documented persistence approach?
